    <h2> Hockey is a diverse sport </h2>
    <p> In terms of international diversity Hockey can be viewed as diverse. Hockey is a sport which can be picked up and played 
      anywhere in the world. </p>
    <h2> Facts </h2>
    <p> In 2016 it was reported the amount of Canadian players, only in the NHL, had deminissed to 43%. Furthermore, it's estimated 35% of
    the sport is built of international players, more diverse than anyother sport in the United States or Canada.</p>
    <h2> Misconception </h2>
    <p> The common misconception throughout time has been Hockey is strictly Canadian because they make up all the Hockey players in the
    world, and if not Canadian then American.</p>
    <h2> Truth of the matter </h2>
    <p> As it has been shown Hockey, for example the NHL, is built up of a diverse group of people. Therefore, it's discouraging to 
    anyone who wishes to play the sport because they would be seen as an outlier. No one would wish to participate in a sport if they
    didn't belong and would rediculed for it. </p>
